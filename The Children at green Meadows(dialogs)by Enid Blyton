<h5><tt>Chapter 1 THE FAMILY AT GREEN MEADOWS</tt></h5>
<h2><tt>Francis:</tt>Mum! Mum! Where are you? Do come here for a minute. I've found the very first snowdrop in our garden.</h2>
<h5><b>Mrs. Marshall came out of the back door, drying her hands on a cloth.</b></h5>
<h2><tt>Mrs. Marshall:</tt>Oh Francis - did you have to call me just when I was so busy washing up?</h2>
<h2><tt>Francis:</tt>Yes I did, Mum. You're always busy, anyway, so it wouldn't matter when I called you. Fancy not even having time to look at a snowdrop. See, there it is!</h2>
<h5><b>(His Mother looked down and saw the tiny white flower with its pretty, drooping head. It grow in a mass of tangled grass, in the corner of the garden. She bent down and shook it gently)</b></h5>
<h2><tt>Francis:</tt>I know why you do that! I knew you would. It's lucky to ring the bell of the first snowdrop you see in the new year, isn't it?</h2>
<h2><tt>Mrs. Marshall(laughing):</tt>That's what country folk say Fransic - and goodness knows we could do with a little good luck!</h2>
<h5><b>(She looked round the big, rambling garden and slipped her arm through the boy's)</b></h5>
<h2><tt>Mrs. Marshall:</tt>I'm not too busy to walk around to see if anything else is coming up. It's St. Valentine's Day, the day all the birds marry - hark at then singing! Even the staring is doing his best - he never learned that he can't sing properly!</h2>
<h5><b>(Fransic was glad to have his mother for a few minutes. He remembered a time when she was ready to run into the garden, to play, to plant seeds, to weed - when she laughed a lot and looked young and happy. Now things were different, and it was quite a treat to  have his mother to himself for a few minutes)</b></h5>
<h2><tt>Mrs. Marshall:</tt> There is a crocus peeping up. And look, over there is actually a violet - in that sheltered corner at the foot of the wall. Let's see if there are primroses in the dell at the bottom of the garden.</h2>
